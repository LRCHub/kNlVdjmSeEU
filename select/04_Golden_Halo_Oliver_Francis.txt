Getting high with your girl, gon' lay low
She a dime with a golden halo
If she want it, she can throw it all in the bag
Right now, got the whole thing in cash
And the interior smell so clean
Matte black on the new SUV
Paid cash on the whip, ain't no lease
You the only one I tell I love
Like fuck all these hoes
You a star baby girl, go ahead glow
Shine bright with the lights down so low
New ice with a clean white polo
New whip, raise up, butterfly doors
New crib with the white marble floors
Good girl with a heart just like gold
Stop pretending, girl, you know it's not ever the same
I think its time we walk away
'Cause honestly
You see, the feeling isn't there and it oughta be
We need a break
Ooh, make your way out the door
And now I'm lying on the bed side
Staring at your side
Waiting for you to grow up
It's something that I can't find
As hard as I try
Every time I press my luck
And now I'm lying on the bed side
Staring at your side
Waiting for you to grow up
It's something that you can't find
As hard as you try
Every time I press my luck
Oh yeah, ay
Press my luck
Press my luck
Yeah
Press my luck
